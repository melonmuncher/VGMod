# VGMod 

This mod is intended to be used for coop


Before hosting a game, you must go in to the armoury and create a blufor deck using the only blufor divsion available. It only needs a command vehicle and will never be used in game.

Changes:

- Increase supplies on all supply vehicles * 10
- Changed all units to axis side (allows any deck to play against any deck)
  - cloned french paras and left on blufor as there must be at least one blufor division 
- Buff panzerfaÃ¼st 44. AP 14 -> 15
- Replace LAW with AT4 on US AeroRifles
